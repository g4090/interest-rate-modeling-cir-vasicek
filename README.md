# interest-rate-modeling-cir-vasicek
This repository contains a project focused on modeling interest rates using the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) and Vasicek models. It simulates interest rate paths using Monte Carlo simulations to compare both models and analyze their behavior, volatility, and implications for risk management and quantitative finance.

Project Overview:
CIR and Vasicek Models: These models are commonly used in finance to model interest rate movements and mean reversion over time.

Monte Carlo Simulations: Multiple simulated paths are generated for both models to visualize potential future interest rate movements and assess risk.

Visualization: Side-by-side comparisons of the models help illustrate differences in volatility, mean reversion, and long-term stability.

Key Insights:
The Vasicek model exhibits higher volatility, particularly at lower interest rates due to constant volatility, while the CIR model is more stable at low rates because its volatility is proportional to the square root of the current rate.

The project provides a deeper understanding of interest rate risk and offers valuable insights for managing fixed-income portfolios and financial derivatives.

Use Cases:
Risk Management: Simulate interest rate paths and analyze potential rate fluctuations to evaluate the risk in fixed-income portfolios.

Quantitative Finance: Understand the application of stochastic processes and Monte Carlo simulations in modeling financial variables.

How to Use:
Clone the repository to access the provided Excel files, which contain the simulation setup, parameter definitions, and results. The Monte Carlo simulations allow users to visualize the paths for both CIR and Vasicek models.
